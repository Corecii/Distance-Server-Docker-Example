# Distance Server Docker Example

This is the configuration I use to host dedicated Distance servers.

This is missing:
* Patched Distance dll at `docker-distance-server/Distance.dll`. See Distance Server's docs for how to patch your Distance dll after purchasing Distance.
* Distance Server at `docker-distance-server/server`. Download this from the Distance Server repository.
